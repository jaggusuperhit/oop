3. why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of oops:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > finction vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well
