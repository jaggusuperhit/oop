1.class and obj (example)
2.class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of oops:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > finction vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritence
    > Inheritence code example
    > why inheritence is needed ?(code reusability, parent has no acces to child class)
    > what gets inherited? - Constrtuctor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
    > Constrtuctor overloading & method overloading
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
    > Types of Inheritence - 1. Single Inheritence | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
